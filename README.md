This week's mini_ex was all about experimenting for me. I used Winnies sketch from class as a starting point and modified my way through. I wanted to do something with the tracking of a face, but without the camera being visible. This was achieved by creating a background in draw, which covers it up. I chose the colours white and red for no other reason than them creating a nice, visible contrast. I found the image of just the dots making the face interesting because it is such a machinic way of portraying a human being. This made me think of how the machines we use, and the data they collect, knows so much about us as individual people. They know what we like, our habits, who we hang out with, where we live and so on. The one thing they have yet to know, is our feelings, deep and inner feelings. This is why I put the text "Tell me how you really feel" across the screen. The quote is from a song I like. I imagined this as a question from the mirrored machinic version of you, which is what the face represents, to the real you. In a way, it is the last step before it knows you completely. In this program, it is a question you can chose to answer. In reality, software might achieve this without our consent, something I believe to be happening already. 


The text becomes visible when your face enters its domain on the screen. Essentially, I used if statements to carve up the screen into grid-like pieces, in which the words reside. I did this in separate if statements instead of else if, because I wanted the possibility of multiple blocks of text to be visible simultaneously.
